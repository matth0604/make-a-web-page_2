  <h2>Web Basics:</h2>
  <p>The web is made up of four basic components; a webpage, HTML, a web browser, and a web server.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Web page</li> 
  A webpage is a simple text file that contains not only text, but also a set of HTML tags that describe how the text should be formatted when a browser displays it on the screen. The tags are simple instructions that tell the Web browser how the page should look when it is displayed. The tags tell the browser to do things like change the font size or color, or arrange things in columns. The Web browser interprets these tags to decide how to format the text onto the screen.
  <li>HTML</li> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. A "markup language" is a computer language that describes how a page should be formatted. If all you want to do is display a long string of black and white text with no formatting, then you don't need HTML. But if you want to change fonts, add colors, create headlines and embed graphics in your page, HTML is the language you use to do it.
    <li>Web Browser</li> A Web browser, like Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer, is a computer program (also known as a software application, or simply an application) that does two things: A Web browser knows how to go to a Web server on the Internet and request a page, so that the browser can pull the page through the network and into your machine. A Web browser knows how to interpret the set of HTML tags within the page in order to display the page on your screen as the page's creator intended it to be viewed.
    <li>Web Server</li> A Web server is a piece of computer software that can respond to a browser's request for a page, and deliver the page to the Web browser through the Internet. You can think of a Web server as an apartment complex, with each apartment housing someone's Web page. In order to store your page in the complex, you need to pay rent on the space. Pages that live in this complex can be displayed to and viewed by anyone all over the world. Your landlord is called your host, and your rent is usually called your hosting charge. Every day, there are millions of Web servers delivering pages to the browsers of tens of millions of people through the network we call the Internet.</div>

   <h2>Developer Tools:</h2>
     <li>HTML:</li> Controls structure and is a language of syntax and rules.
     <li>CSS-Cascading Style Sheet:</li> CSS changes how things look.  Important for larger webpages where multiple pages are involved in order to save time rewriting the HTML code on every page.  CSS also helps prevent errors as computers are "stupid" in a sense that if you miss one closing tag it will cause everything to continue to be styled the way you selected in the element prior.  Plus, the more code a computer has to read the slower your pages will load and we all know people want what they want and they want it now.
     <li>JS-Javascript:</li> JS is used to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites.
  </div></ol>

   <div id="dom">
     <h2>Document Object Model:</h2>DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.</div><br><br>
